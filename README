This is a fork of the cobertura project.

The svn url is https://cobertura.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cobertura/trunk/cobertura

This fork accompishes the following things:
  Only a subset of the main files are included. Ant and Command Line support remain.
  Needed jars have been unjar'd. Everything is baked into one jar now.
  Interfaces are not marked and will no longer show up as 'N/A'. They don't show up at all.
  Reports may be generated without frames. Use the --noframes options.
